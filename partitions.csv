# Partition scheme version 1
#
# When updating this scheme you must change scheme version:
#
# 1. Bump the partiton scheme version
# 2. Update the provisioning scripts to write the new scheme version
#   to partition "dev_id".
#
# Note that updating firmware which changes the partition scheme on a previously
# provisioned device is not a trivial operation and cannot be done remotely.
# The steps for updating existing devices using UART bootloader or debugger are:
#
# 1. If you're updating firmware on any device with an old partitioning scheme,
#   this device must have it's Flash erased.
# 2. After erasing the device must be provisioned again. Presumably it'll
#   restore its keypair and certificate from storage, but config will be lost.
# 3. Finally, you can update it's firmware.

# Flash memory map (4MB of SPI Flash). Partitions marked (external) are
# either immutable or defined elsewhere (i.e. by bootloader / partition table
# menuconfig configuration option CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET).
